      "The goal of the project is to carry out a data analysis on a subset of git repositories; our goals are twofold. Firstly we want to characterize developers by their git activities. By analyzing repository metadata we  will seek to identify a developer's area of expertise and develop metrics in an effort to quantify his \"skill level.\"  The general purpose  is to allow employer looking for a freelancer with a certain skillset to find a good man for the job. The second goal is to determine the \"accessibility\" of an opensource project for a certain developer profile. Having determined a developer's ability, we want to identify projects in his desired area which are at an appropriate level for him to make a contribution. \n",
